# IntelligenceArtificielle

This is a code developped in python using the tkinter library. It has been created to play with the Dall-E AI which is an AI that can generate images written in a prompt. For instance, if you write "cute cat" in Dall-E's prompt, it will generate several cat pictures (because we all know cats are always cute).
This application is a game in which you can enter a hidden prompt and make your friends guess what you have written according to the image genrated by Dall-E. Indeed, if your friends find the prompt message, you win, else, you lose.
